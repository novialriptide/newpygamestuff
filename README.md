pygame_geometry is a free Python implementation of
polygons, circles, lines, and raycasting. The main
purpose of this repository is to help users integrate
special colliders easier for their video game. The plan
for the project's future is to migrate all modules to
the main [pygame repository](https://github.com/pygame/pygame).

**Everything you see in this repository is subject to change as
this project is heavily in development.** This decision is also
subject to change when this project migrates to the
[official pygame repository](https://github.com/pygame/pygame) or
becomes a third-party library.

## Installation
Please follow [this guide](https://github.com/novialriptide/pygame_geometry/blob/main/BUILD.md)
to install pygame_geometry.

## Help
The documentation is a work in progress, but you can check
out the `examples` folder to learn how to use this library.

## Contributing Guidelines
In order to contribute to the project, you must follow these guidelines...
1. Follow PEP8 convention naming rules for C and Python
2. Lint your code with [black](https://github.com/psf/black)
3. Please make an issue first before submitting a pull request
4. Always add unittests when you're introducing something new
5. For C code, try to use `FASTCALL` as much as you can
6. Make sure your code actually works before you submit a pull
request
7. Please be patient when waiting for pull request reviews,
we are all unpaid-volunteers
